We need a solid understanding of the Machine learning/Deep learning stuff, at least familiar with them.

In the first year of graduate life, I attended some classes related to these, like:

* [A sample back propagation implementation in Mr. Feng's class](https://github.com/MiaoDX/bp_java)
* [Use `sklearn` in `Big data algorithms` class taught by Mr. Hao.](https://github.com/MiaoDX/scikit_learning)
* [Some reinforcement projects on macman in `Advanced AI` taught by Mr. Hao.](https://github.com/MiaoDX/hand_in_homework/tree/master/Advanced_AI)
* [Some tensorflow implements of DL algorithms (faster-RCNN) in the final project in `Computer Graphics` taught by Ms. Wan](https://github.com/MiaoDX/hand_in_homework/tree/master/Computer_Graphics/Project)

It's good to know how to use the libraries, however, better to have some in-depth understanding. I will try to finish some tutorials/courses/blogs and so on and make some notes here, codes are also included.

There are numerous resources out there, so the choices here are somewhat casual and it can be a long journey, good luck & have fun. :)

To make things more smooth and have a schedule, weekly process **plan** are listed below:

* July 23 - 29
